# Open Loop Front End take home coding challenge

## `The Challenge`

Build a React app that presents a user with a form, performs some simple validation, adds submissions to a list, and allows the user to remove submissions from said list.

## `Requirements`

- Built with React. Feel free to use *`Create React App`* if you'd prefer, along with any other libraries (UI, forms, validation, etc.) that help you get the job done.
- Form on the left, list of submissions on the right.
- The first field in the form should auto-focus on page load and after each submission.
- Form contains fields for: first name, last name, email, and note.
- Each item in the submissions list should display: first name, last name, note, and email.
- All form fields are required.
- If a field has a validation error, display a status message below it, and indicate the error with a red border.
- Ensure the email field value is the correct format.
- Disable form submissions unless the form is valid.
- Reset the form on submit.
- Allow the user to remove submissions from the list.
